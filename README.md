## Work Experience

### Research Assistant  
*2019 – Present*  
- Developed efficient algorithms for quantum state preparation: Created a novel method to prepare quantum states that improve the efficiency of measurement-based quantum computation, including simulations to test its accuracy using **Python**.
- Proposed a framework for identifying material phases in quantum systems: Introduced a method to determine the phase of matter in quantum systems after measurements, with potential applications in material science and quantum computing.
- Discovered new approaches for studying topological properties of quantum systems: Found a method to derive topological order states from symmetry-protected states, contributing to our understanding of exotic phases of matter.
- Published three papers on non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theory (QFT) in peer-reviewed journals, advancing our knowledge of physical phenomena beyond standard approximations.
- Designed a computational tool in **Mathematica** for solving Chiral Differential Operators, streamlining calculations in theoretical physics.
- Organized and led a weekly graduate seminar on advanced topics in high-energy physics, fostering academic discussion and collaboration among 20 students.
- Delivered invited talks at leading academic institutions and workshops, including:
  - **Measurement and Phases of Matter** at Sherbrooke University, April 2024
  - **Symmetry TFTs** at Yang Institute of Theoretical Physics, September 2023
  - **Chiral Life on a Slab** at GLSM Workshop, Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, May 2023
